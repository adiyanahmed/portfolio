		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Hi, my name is Adiyan Ahmed. Welcome to my website portfolio!
		I've created this website in order to teach myself web development
		as well as to create a page with information about myself if anyone 
		is curious. This website contains links to some random projects I've 
		worked on in the past, my resume/CV, and links to my github and 
		other social media platforms where I can be reached. </p>
		<!-- <img src="images/pic of me.jpg" data-rotate="rotate90"> -->
		<p>About myself, I am 20 years old and a 3rd year Computer Engineering
		student at McMaster University. I have a very strong interest in technology
		and computers in general (duh) and I'm a geek for new PC tech. My hobbies
		include gaming and basketball (#WeTheNorth baby let's get it!). Now 
		that you know more about me, please feel free to look around my website
		and contact me if you have any questions, or even if you just want 
		to talk :)</p>
